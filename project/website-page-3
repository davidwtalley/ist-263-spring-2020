            <p>In the mood for some icecream? Pittsford Farms Dairy started as a small milk stand in the village, proving fresh, organic milk to the local village residents. A few years back, the family opened a larger location which now serves some of the best icecream in town. If you get a chance, try out their chocolate milk!</p>

            <img src="./website-pictures/richardsons-building.jpg" alt="richardson's canalhouse">
            <p>This casual-gourmet Austrian restaurant is perfect for a special occasion. Established in the early 1800s, the building was first used as a brothel and an inn for the people on the ships coming into Bushnell's Basin. The best time to go to Richardson's is in the summertime, when the outdoor patio and grill area are open. Reserve a table and come a few minutes early to enjoy a signature drink near one of the firepits outside.</p>

            <p>Known by the locals as Tillo's, this tiny pizza shop in Bushnell's Basin (across the road from Richardson's) has the best slice in town. Order a Bobby (cheese), a Roni (pepperoni) pizza, or a locals' favorite - buffalo chicken and enjoy it at one of the picnic tables outside or on the go. </p>
