            <p>Sam Patch takes you on a guided tour of one of the most famous canals in the United States. The two hour scenic tour can be used to get from Pittsord to other towns or relax in the Upstate NY sunshine. If you are lucky, you will see the Pittsford Crew Rowing Team practicing their strokes next to the boat. After the tour, make sure to feed the ducks along the canal with some duck food that you can purchase for $1 in the local stores.</p>
